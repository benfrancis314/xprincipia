                Much as writing allowed for information to extend through time, 
                the internet allows for information to extend through space. 
                <br />
                <br />
                In this way, billions of human minds are able to be intimately connected, 
                forming a type of ultraorganism. 
                <br />
                <br />
                However, this internet-based ultraorganism is today primarily used only for social interaction, entertainment, and commerce. 
                <br />
                <br />
                There exists no centralized nexus for pushing human progress further, for solving our 
                greatest problems and achieving our grandest goals. 
                <br />
                <br />
                This centralized location would take the form of a website, allowing anyone to
                access and contribute to leading-edge scientific and technological thought. 
                It would focus people upon major projects, determined to be most critical for the future of humanity. 
                <br />
                <br />
                People would create proposals of their ideas, discuss them as a community, and 
                iterate versions of them as they become improved towards perfection. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Eventually, the core group of people contributing to the intellectual progress of humanity would
                extend from academia and private industry to the civilization in general. 
                Our rate of discovery would accelerate; in our lifetimes we would achieve unthought of change, 
                perhaps interplanetary colonies or the cessation of aging.
