/*Welcome to XPrincipia: The Open Frontier of Research.

Here anyone, regardless of background or class, may openly contribute to and join todayâ€™s cutting edge of scientific research and technology development. 

For the first time, we allow every impassioned person with internet access to explore the frontier of modern projects towards advancing our human civilization into its proper future. 

Included along this frontier are the projects driving humanity towards becoming an interstellar civilization and perfecting our biological organism out of choice; included here are the aims of completing our theoretical understanding of the universe we find ourselves in and of developing the technologies needed for all scopes of these ambitions. 

These goals sit high in challenge and in so need not only institutions nor the private sector in work towards them, but rather the force of all prepared and willing minds towards their achievement. 

For the first time, we allow <blue>every</> skilled craftsman to directly contribute towards the aims of each challenging project. 

For the first time, we invite <blue>you</>, wherever you may come from, to create and breakdown new projects, to design and discover your own proposals towards each aim and to debate those of your peers, with perfection in mind by all. 

For the first time, we unveil a system attempting to truly and absolutely democratize science and human progress, utilizing the advent of the internet and the growing ambition of our generations, culminating in this moment. 

For the unlearnt or virtuously determined mind, we provide a new way to learn, allowing peer to teach peer with focus upon mastering each project for future achievement. 

For all of the collected works and every waiting decision, <blue>your vote</> determines the most important projects, the best proposals and the most valuable points of discussion. 

The entire architecture of XPrincipia, constantly shifting at democratic will, is up to you.

Our success, and the fruit it may bare, is up to us all.
