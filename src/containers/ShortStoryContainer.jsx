              <span id="storyCapitalProse1">it was the year of the discovery</span>. 
                Unlike the great discoveries of the past, this came not with a flash or moment of inflection, nor with any proceeding hysteria; this discovery came silently, gently upon the populace. 
                In the years before, we had switched to a method of progress that no longer relied on giant feats from geniuses of antiquity; rather, each person now laid their own incrementation forward, synchronized in large-scale design. 
                This became known, affectionately, as<i> pebbles o'er boulders</i>. 
                However, this subtle shift in strategy was largely unseen by the cultured-public, until subtle advancements lead to full-blown changes upon the civilization, in the forms of human spaceflight, renewable energy, and genetic engineering. 
                It was in the midst of this Second Age of Discovery that another great theory emerged; some even claim upon accident. 
                <br />
                <br />
            </div>
              <div id="story1Logo2">
                  A theory of consciousness was long thought to be impossible, let alone to boil the matter down to a mathematical framework of consistency. 
                  Arguments were made against the feat immediately; Gödel was invoked in oft erroneous objections, yet the theory held its ground against even the most stern challenges. 
                  However, just as the footing of this movement began to firm, a new, equally accidental discovery was made. 
                  Through an unconventional manipulation of one of the equations, which was singularly esoteric in nature, came something unsettling.
                  <br />
                  <br />
              </div>
              <div id="story1Logo3">
                  It was once believed that the variables of the theory were all accounted for, each degree of freedom exactly as the empirical data dictated it should be. 
                  This new finding, completed by a now-famed post-doc, found something unaccounted for. 
                  It appeared that, if the rest of the theory were to retain its validity, there must be a new term introduced into one of the core axioms. 
                  It also appeared that humans are wired for this variable in only one way — but this is not the only compatible configuration. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </div>
                  Here I enter the story. 
                  Upon this realization, a frenzy ensued among the community and peripheral society; if this claim were true, what would the alternatives mean? 
                  And so a month of philosophizing began; while I set out at work. 
                  I knew that someone eventually would engineer a way to manipulate this variable in the human mind itself, and see what lays on the other side. 
                  I also knew that whoever would invent this method, and use it for the first time, was destined for historical glory. 
                  And this is why I alone will do so. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                <div id="story1Logo5">
                  I have, prepared for me now, the secret to unlocking this fundamental change. 
                  Using enormous personal resources reserved to my estate, I have been able to both crack the mathematical tribulations required and reverse-engineer the exact biochemical means for effecting these equations. 
                  Curiously enough, with the proper configurations, it appears this variability can maximize the effects of consciousness, given the current anatomical status of human brains. 
                  It is, still today, debated as to what this entirely means. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  But I digress, partly in my nerves. I have gathered myself alone on this fateful day, for this timelessly important experiment. 
                  In moments I will ingest the chemical solution required to produce the effects, which should fully and safely return to normalization within the hour. 
                  Afterwards, if all goes according to plan, I will prepare a research paper definitively describing the results, as well as the necessary procedures I have invented in my prior secrecy. 
                  <br />

                <div id="story1Logo6">
                  As for the moment itself, I settled down in a chair, in a serene and arboreal location of nature. 
                  A perfect half-kilometer separates myself radially from any other disturbances. 
                  I whisked out of my pocket a glass drinking-bottle, with a haste that would have revealed my excited state, had I not been alone. 
                  I meditated, briefly, and began to drink the translucent potion. 
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  At approximately the time of my finishing of the vial, I noticed the beginnings of a new peculiarity. 
                  I glanced about the garden for an empty reassurance, then gripped my chair; I knew, in exacting fashion, of the uncertainty that I now draw near.

                <span id="storyCapitalProse2">hope had been born on the ship, the mission was all she knew</span>. 
                It was a journey to another star, but Hope had been born without a star to call home. 
                Alpha Centauri would be her first. 
                She spent her days, for lack of a better term, analyzing the data that they received from the unmanned ships sent before them. 
                It was on a normal day that she encountered the first anomaly, one of those life changing happenings that makes you forget that someone had spilt coffee on you that morning. 
                Squares. Almost perfect squares. 
                That’s all anyone could make out. 
                It meant something to Hope the way the topside of an iceberg means a vast frozen monolith below. 
                That was the beginning.
                <br />
                <br />
                As the days went by, Hope’s findings increased exponentially. 
                Large figures had been carved or cut out of the local landscape, a giant: we’re here, find us, to the open sky. 
                These signs were, to Hope, the first gasping breaths of a baby, and there was life. 
                She spent hours contemplating what society must be like there, how the two civilizations meeting would change everything. 
                For the first time in her life she felt truly alive and purposeful, in a way that only a vindicated daydream getting closer and closer to reality can make you feel.
                <br />
                <br />
                The decisions however, were not left to Hope, hers was the work of analysis. 
                She worked meticulously to compile her report. 
                After weeks of evaluating, they were able to place the planet’s average civilization level around the equivalent of the ancient Renaissance period of Earth. 
                There were so many places Hope felt they could engage this civilization and help them grow. 
                Hope imagined an Earth where, after the Renaissance, humanity had been lifted out of its own folly and shown the way to prosperity. 
                She finished her report, deviating from procedure by adding an appendix detailing ways she had dreamt up about how to best interact and aide the planets young society. 
                Feeling as if she were both mother and teacher to everyone on this far away planet, she sent in her report; slightly disappointed, but not surprised, when a response wasn’t received right away.

                  <span id="storyCapitalProse1">immediately i could feel my cognition shift</span>. 
                  The effects betrayed a certain iridescence, of which I cannot place in regards to comparison. 
                  As to how this might reveal the presumed maxima of human cognition, I knew yet not; but my curiosity and fear staggered.

                  Plentifully, and now in rapid succession, were deep mathematical suggestions; seemingly damning our classical axiomatic-constructions, yet praising and exaggerating the concepts of both irrational numbers and the integers. 
                  At this, I smiled precociously at the thought of how I might use this in my paper upon return. 
                  <br />
                  <br />

                <div id="story1Logo9">
                  I settled, but only briefly; suddenly the corners and geometries jumped, almost sharpening to a point I can only identify with the most unsettling pseudo-memories, perhaps best analogized as that of a lost smell or childhood dream.  
                  <br />
                  <br />

                <div id="story1Logo10">
                  My heart suddenly began speeding; yet my mind was oddly calm. 
                  Strange, yes, but I supposed Galileo must have felt similar when his eyes first set upon the godly awe of Jupiter, alone in the canvas of open space. 
                  My new-found confidence did not last, however, as a strange hum raised from my lower spine — it climbed vertically until it mounted at my temple where it seemed to burst; confounded, I now sat amongst an entirely new host of reality and apparent geographic location. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </div>
                <div id="story1Logo11">
                  If there were once mathematical suggestibilities in form, here were now grandiose and outrageous claims upon our basis of <i>physicas</i>; I grasped for a concept of relation, anything linguistic or numero-dynamically applicable — I found none. 
                  As my thoughts and logic grasped and took aim at recovery, I saw what I knew would complete their state of utter disrepair: An entity, of which I dare not call anything more, was suspended just meters from my very location! 
                  I cannot evade the feeling that I was anticipated. 
                  The question of the things origin drew deeply now in my chest; I wondered, tentatively, what unwonted intellect it might host. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </div>
                <div id="story1Logo12">
                  In what form it had, it was utterly remote from any produced by natural evolution of carbon-cellular life or by the entirety of man-created culture. 
                  It was both fabulous and disturbing in its glaring distance from any design of which we have known. 
                  At the next moment I knew my mind was lost; for out from its acting mouth came a linguistic feat and geometric structure incomparable to even the most divine inspirations or visionary accomplishments in all of mammalia-human existence; I understood this to be the daemon communicating with me, and I felt weak in constitution from my incomparable inability to respond. 
                  <br />
                  <br />

                <div id="story1Logo13">
                  With a gentle firmness, it commanded I look at what it had apparently offered to me; and so, without much desire to disagree with the thing, I did. 
                  As I sat in ghast, before my eyes was <i>the</i> knowledge, the eternal answers we had always sought, even to questions unasked; it was part equation in form, describing an aeon-matured omniscience, yet also, through uncomfortable yet distinctly apparent suggestions, a glimpse of many deeper, stranger laws that could not be accounted for or classified. 
                  <br />
                  <br />

                <div id="story1Logo14">
                  The being lured me away before any deeper reflections of the hyper-dimensional relief were allowed, and lead me into a deeper space. 
                  It felt as a domed room, cavernous in size and shape, yet I saw no border or wall in sight. 
                  Here it deposited me and gathered with others of its kind, now coalescing in multiple series of sharp, concentric ellipses about a center to the space; and it was here that I looked and saw what may only be described as God, or possibly the source of God, as humans construct it. 
                  This <i>mecca</i>-structure, visually represented as sets of eccentric spherical vortices, seemed to guide the flow of all entelechial information; this was surely the supreme achievement of this distant species, either crafted or discovered, over the millennia in this distant space.

                  It was here, at my final moments of retaining whatever sanity preluded my appearance in this new world, that I let go, and joined the impossible flowing of intention, data and energy. 
                  Whatever forces possessed this eternal realm, I knew not, but as I glanced down at the now-millions of alien forms among me, each hovering and dancing feverishly about the centralized monolith, I no longer cared.

                <span id="storyCapitalProse2">for hope, time had always been the enemy</span>, but now it had become her torturer, mocking her with every second, minute and hour that passed. 
                She couldn’t understand why they had not received any word on how to proceed. 
                She felt they had taken enough time to make the decision a dozen times over and still nothing. 
                It worried her more that from their observations they could see that a massive conflict was starting to engulf one of her favorite corners of the planet. 
                She wanted to be able to save them from themselves and show them how it was possible to come together as one people, as Earth eventually had, and how to prosper. 
                She still dreamt of being their Joan of Arc, their guardian angel.
                <br />
                <br />
                When word finally came, Hope’s dream withered. 
                They were to observe. 
                Watch, but not interact. 
                Let them grow on their own and when the time was right, when they figured it out on their own, greet them as equals. 
                They had been so close, and now Hope would never set foot on any planet in her lifetime. 
                They were estimated to be a couple centuries from the appointed level at which any communication would be authorized. 
                By the time any human was able to make contact, Hope wouldn’t be around to see it.
                <br />
                <br />
                But still she watched. Hope grew old getting to know the ins and outs of every society she could on her planet. 
                Hope had a family, daughters, sons, granddaughters, and grandsons. 
                And Hope died. 
                63 years after Hope’s death another ship arrived carrying genetic engineering technology that allowed the human body to become biologically immortal, so that no one like Hope would have to die watching ever again.
                <br />
                <br />
                This wasn’t the last miraculous advancement they had missed during their voyage. 
                Ships kept arriving, each bringing its own wonder to share with the watchers. 
                Eventually they were able to bring the technologies and knowledges that had earned by the conquest of the last problem and the indoctrination into the all-knowledge shared by the watchers humanity never knew they’d had. 
                Some on the ships wondered if ever these watchers had any ancestors such as Hope, that had loved their subjects but never made it all the way to the encounter. 
                With all this, it can be said that they almost jumped from mere observer to enlightened gods, surely it must have seemed so to the primitive subjects of their study if any had chance to encounter one of the newly ascendant observers. 286 years later the Alpha Centaurians reached out and grasped the final iota of knowledge they had been missing, that last variable of consciousness. Hope’s great-great-granddaughter was the first to communicate with them when they arrived, Hope’s dream fulfilled at last, the cycle complete.
